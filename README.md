### Project Description
PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM is a software solution designed to automate the distribution of essentials commodities through government authorized rationshops.It streamline inventory management beneficiary authentication,transaction tracking and reporting to ensure fair and efficient distribution while reducing fraud and manual errors.

### The Problem statement
1.DELAYS IN RATION DISTRIBUTION-Inefficient process leads to delays,causing inconveniance to beneficiaries who depend on timely distribution.
2.LACK OF REAL TIME MONITORING-Authorities cannot track stock levels,transactions or beneficiaries data in real time,leading to inefficies.
3.LIMITED ACCESSIBILITY FOR BENEFICIARIES-Lack of online or mobile-based services forces beneficiaries to visit shops physically,increasing their burden.
4.MISCOMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND SHOPS-Delays in policy updates or stock allocations due to lack of an efficient communication system.
5.TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS-Long queue and slow manual processing reduce efficiency and cause inconvenience to beneficiaries. 

### The Solution
1.Fraud Prevention Measures -Integrate biometric authentication and unique digital ration cards to prevent unauthorized transactions.
2.Real-Time Inventory Management* ‚Äì Use automated stock tracking and alerts to ensure accurate stock management and prevent shortages or pilferage.  
3.Beneficiary Authentication System ‚Äì Implement an AI-based eligibility check and biometric verification to ensure only eligible beneficiaries receive rations.  
4.Queue Management System ‚Äì Introduce token-based or online scheduling systems to reduce waiting times and improve efficiency.  
6. Automated Reporting and Transparency ‚Äì Generate real-time reports on transactions, stock levels, and distribution patterns to ensure transparency and prevent corruption.  
7.Fast and Efficient Distribution ‚Äì Use barcode or QR-based scanning for quick verification and transaction processing, reducing delays.  
8. Mobile and Online Accessibility‚Äì Develop a mobile app or web portal for beneficiaries to check ration status, stock availability, and shop timings.    
12. Seamless Communication System‚Äì Integrate real-time communication between government authorities and ration shop owners through SMS, email, or mobile apps.
